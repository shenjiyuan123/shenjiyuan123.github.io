This is a collection of thoughts and advice on a wide range of topics, specifically about my daily life, updated whenever I think of something new. It is very much work-in-progress.

## Sport

I enjoy all kinds of outdoor sports and especially I love basketball most. Recently I've been on a fitness and hope to be a muscle man. Fighting~ 

## Music

Jay Zhou's new album is awesome and I cannot bear that someone hasn't listened this yet.
