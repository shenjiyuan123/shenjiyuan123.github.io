## About Me
Hi there! I am SHEN Jiyuan (沈纪元). I am a second-year Master by research student at Nanyang Technological University with the [SCRIPTS scholarship](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scripts/home). I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [LAM, Kwok Yan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/kwokyan.lam/). Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree with a major in Intelligent Science and Technology (Department of Computer Science and Engineering) from Shanghai University in 2022, under the supervison of Prof. [Xing Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rRQ_BQIAAAAJ&hl=en). I have interned in [Bosch Corporate Research](https://www.bosch.com/), mentored by Dr. Dong Chen.


My primary research interest lies in following directions:

1. Dataset Compression: Data-efficient Learning, Dataset Distillation, One-shot FL
2. Federated Learning: Secure Aggregation, Fast Recovery from Poison Attacks, Model Inversion Attacks
3. Computer Vision: Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Data Generation, Portrait Beautification
